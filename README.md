# Book creator
Back in 2015 I wanted something which gave me a super simple & clear overview of the content of the book I was writing, a way of managing versions of the chunks of text, and the ability to export it into a nice PDF or ebook format. I couldn't find that, so I decided to built it!

This is based on that app I built; feel free to use it however you want.

- Clone this repository
- Run `rake db:schema:load`
- Run `rails s`
- Start writing!
